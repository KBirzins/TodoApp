# Simple Todo application

This is a simple todo application that allows you to add/edit/delete todos and filter and search them.
It is wired up with firebase and firestore, but no data is currently persisted there.

To run on ios, navigate to `ios` folder and run `pod install`. Afterwards run `cd ..` to go back and `yarn ios`.
To run on android, you need to open the android folder with android studio, sync and refresh the gradle project, then run `yarn android`.
